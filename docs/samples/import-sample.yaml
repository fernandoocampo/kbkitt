Value: type of machine learning. it is a type of predictive machine learning in which the data comes with labels, where the label is the target we are interested in predicting. Remember-Formulate-Predict.
Notes: The model first remembers the dataset of dogs and cats, then formulates a model, or a rule for what is a dog and what is a cat, and when a new image comes in, the model makes a prediction about what the label of the image is, namely, is it a dog or a cat.

Key: stack memory
Value: part of memory available to your code to use at runtime. All data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size.

Key: heap memory
Value: 'The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you request a certain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a pointer, which is the address of that location.'
Notes: This process is called allocating on the heap and is sometimes abbreviated as just allocating (pushing values onto the stack is not considered allocating). Because the pointer to the heap is a known, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you want the actual data, you must follow the pointer.
