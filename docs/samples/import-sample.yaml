Value: 'The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you request a certain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a pointer, which is the address of that location.'
Notes: This process is called allocating on the heap and is sometimes abbreviated as just allocating (pushing values onto the stack is not considered allocating). Because the pointer to the heap is a known, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you want the actual data, you must follow the pointer.

    By the very nature of its architecture, no LLM can reason.

    One might see dim reflections of inductive and deductive reasoning only in so far as the training data set contains such examples, but abductive reasoning - indeed any color of reasoning that requires the production of new abstractions - is unreachable..
Notes: This is not to say that LLMs have no utility - they do - but it is to say that one should not give LLMs powers they do not and cannot possess. To think this is an AGI or even a path to AGI is folly.

Value: https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2024/02/kubernetes-cpu-limits-go.html
Notes: I believe there are many Go services running in K8s under CPU limits that are not running as efficiently as they otherwise could be. In this post, I will explain what I learned and show what happens when CPU limits are being used and your Go service isn’t configured to run within the scope of that setting.

Value: https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2024/02/kubernetes-memory-limits-go.html
Notes: After writing the Kubernetes (K8s) CPU Limits post, I was wondering what happens when a K8s memory limit is set for the same service. I’ve been hearing at workshops and at Ardan how people are experiencing Out Of Memory (OOM) problems with their PODs when setting K8s memory limits. I’m often told that when an OOM occurs, K8s will terminate and restart the POD.

Notes: OAuth 2.0 is an authorization protocol and NOT an authentication protocol. As such, it is designed primarily as a means of granting access to a set of resources, for example, remote APIs or user data.

Low latency is desirable in online gaming as it contributes to a more realistic gaming environment. However, the term low latency is most often used to describe specific business use cases, in particular high-frequency trading in capital markets.

Key: grpc
Value: In gRPC, a client application can directly call a method on a server application on a different machine as if it were a local object, making it easier for you to create distributed applications and services. As in many RPC systems, gRPC is based around the idea of defining a service, specifying the methods that can be called remotely with their parameters and return types. On the server side, the server implements this interface and runs a gRPC server to handle client calls. On the client side, the client has a stub (referred to as just a client in some languages) that provides the same methods as the server.
Notes: gRPC can use protocol buffers as both its Interface Definition Language (IDL) and as its underlying message interchange format

Key: protocol-buffers
Value: Protocol Buffers are a language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanism for serializing structured data.
Notes: |-
    It’s like JSON, except it’s smaller and faster, and it generates native language bindings. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.

    Protocol buffers are a combination of the definition language (created in .proto files), the code that the proto compiler generates to interface with data, language-specific runtime libraries, the serialization format for data that is written to a file (or sent across a network connection), and the serialized data.

Key: rest
Value: REST can be defined as a stateless, layered and cacheable client-server architecture that operates with resources using a uniform command interface based on HTTP verbs. A resource is an entity (such as a document or file) that can be addressed with a unique resource locator (URL).
Notes: |-
    REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is arguably the most discussed API architecture style, and certainly one of the most used.

    The strongest REST convention is to use a URL to express the resource you're working with, and a HTTP verb to express the action to take.

    REST aims to follow HTTP semantics closely: a REST request is structured like an HTTP request

Key: cqrs-pattern
Value: CQRS stands for Command and Query Responsibility Segregation, a pattern that separates read and update operations for a data store. Implementing CQRS in your application can maximize its performance, scalability, and security.
Notes: |-
    So, what’s the best way to get started using the CQRS patterns in your microservices architecture? First, clearly define the Commands and Queries specific to your application or service. Understanding which operations will modify the state and which will only read data is essential.

    Next, you should design separate Command and Query Models tailored to your application's operational needs. This involves optimizing each model to ensure it can function effectively within the system.

    The CQRS pattern works well with the Event Sourcing patterns, so you should consider adopting an Event Store to capture all changes in your systems as a series of events.

Key: edge-computing
Value: Edge computing is a distributed computing framework that brings enterprise applications closer to data sources such as IoT devices or local edge servers.
Notes: Sending all device-generated data to a centralized data center or to the cloud causes bandwidth and latency issues. Edge computing offers a more efficient alternative; data is processed and analyzed closer to the point where it's created. Because data does not traverse over a network to a cloud or data center to be processed, latency is reduced. Edge computing—and mobile edge computing on 5G networks—enables faster and more comprehensive data analysis, creating the opportunity for deeper insights, faster response times and improved customer experiences.
