# KBKITT

The tool to manage your knowledge base

## Why?

Cognitive load is a real problem and you see it most clearly when you start new projects, new jobs, new ventures, new hobbies or even trying to remember what you did in that previous project or task or yesterday.

kbkitt aims to help you easily remember all those interesting facts you've collected over the years.

User experience is the main goal
